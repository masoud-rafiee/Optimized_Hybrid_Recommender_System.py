# ⚠️ Data Folder Instructions
# i didn't want to upload data here because it was pointless, you can find it on the kaggle website as below are the instructions:
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The full dataset is too large to host in this repository. (I could use git lfs but it's not useful to do so in this case)
>
> 1. Download the **MovieLens 20M** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset/data).
> 2. Extract the archive and copy the following CSV files into this `data/` folder:
>    - `ratings.csv`
>    - `movies.csv`
>    - `tags.csv`
>    - `links.csv`
>    - (optional) other files such as `genome-scores.csv`, `genome-tags.csv`
>
> Once these files are in place, rerun the project scripts from the root directory.  
> Thank you!
